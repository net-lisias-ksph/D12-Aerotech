# D12 Aerotech :: Change Log

* 2014-0909: 0.0.1.2 (cremasterstroke Unofficial) for KSP 0.24.2
	+ based on CSVoltage's fix - thanks for getting the ball rolling and most of the work done
	+ made with B12 R5.2.1 (not included), Firespitter 6.3.5 (plugin and sound included), ModuleManager 2.3.5 (plugin included) - thanks to their respective authors for their continuing excellent work
all IVAs and textures should now be back to normal
	+ added Firespitter soundbank to CSVoltage's package - without it your engines would be silent - that's why this file is much larger
installation same as before
	+ changed internal name for canards to avoid conflict with stock part - if you have pre-existing craft with this part, please replace the /GameData/B9_Aerospace/Expansions/D12Wingtech/canards.cfg with the one from the previous version, or open it and edit the `name =` line back to `name = CanardController`

* 2014-0902: 0.0.1.1 (CSVoltage Unofficial) for KSP 0.24.2
	+ Now compatible with B9 R5.0 pre-release.
	+ I changed the pointers for files to work with the new textures and moved textures that the new ones don't work with to the D12 assets folder, along with some props and the latest firespitter and module manager.

* 2014-0601: 0.0.0.2 Squad Knockout (PolecatEZ) for KSP 0.23.5
	+ This will replace select squad parts, including all wings, Mk2 fuselage and adapter, and the inline RCS tank (maybe a few others). This will also give you all other parts.
	+ All previously saved craft should load just fine, you may need to tweak them in the SPH though as wing dimensions changed slightly.
	+ Inline parts have identical node placement to the originals so you shouldn't need to tear too much apart otherwise.
* 2014-0429: 0.0.0.1 Supplemental (PolecatEZ) for KSP 0.23.5
	+ Simply gives you all Squad replacements as ****X files without killing Squad parts, they're just added to the catalog.
	+ Also includes new parts.
* 2014-0426: 0.0.0 (PolecatEZ) for KSP 0.23.5
	+ Early Alpha
