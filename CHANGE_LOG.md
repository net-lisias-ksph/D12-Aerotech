	+ https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/70562-wipd12-aerotech-a-b9-aerospace-expansion-beta1/&do=findComment&comment=1133394
* 2014-0601: 0.0.0.2 Squad Knockout (PolecatEZ) for KSP 0.23.5
	+ This will replace select squad parts, including all wings, Mk2 fuselage and adapter, and the inline RCS tank (maybe a few others). This will also give you all other parts.
	+ All previously saved craft should load just fine, you may need to tweak them in the SPH though as wing dimensions changed slightly.
	+ Inline parts have identical node placement to the originals so you shouldn't need to tear too much apart otherwise.
* 2014-0429: 0.0.0.1 Supplemental (PolecatEZ) for KSP 0.23.5
	+ Simply gives you all Squad replacements as ****X files without killing Squad parts, they're just added to the catalog.
	+ Also includes new parts.
* 2014-0426: 0.0.0 (PolecatEZ) for KSP 0.23.5
	+ Early Alpha
