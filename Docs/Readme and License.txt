3.  Module Manager is helpful for community fixes.
4.  Install this folder from the pack exactly as you see it, it likes things to be in the tree structure that is here.
5.  Enjoy your stuff.  Let me know if there are any issues.

This is a testing early alpha, be prepared to delete this and install a full release later.  I'll try to keep everything backwards compatible.
